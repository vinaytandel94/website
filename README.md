# Page Layout:
The first start of the website was to set up responsive page layout 
for different web pages that I am going to use for displaying information.
I have used Youtube tutorial for building HTML website with responsive layout 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw&t=2677s) from this video 
I have managed to create a responsive web page layout and added all the pages that I needed.

# Added all the contain for home page with information and images and also created ccs for contain structure.

# I have used HTML checker tool for any code error. the only code error that appeared was an alt attribute was missing for images.
I have managed to add alt attribute for the image.

#created event.html page and adding image transition.

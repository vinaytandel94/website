# Page Layout:
The first start of the website was to set up responsive page layout 
for different web pages that I am going to use for displaying information.
I have used Youtube tutorial for building HTML website
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw&t=2677s) from this video 
I have managed to create a responsive web page layout and added all the pages that I needed.

# Added all the contain for home page with information and images and also created ccs for contain structure.
On the index page I have also added slideshow from W3SCHOOL  https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_slideshow_self
I did have an issue with onclick function and could not change to other function so decided to use on click. 

# I have used HTML checker tool for any code error. the only code error that appeared was an alt attribute was missing for images.
I have managed to add alt attribute for the image.

#created event.html page and adding image transition. 
#event.html page was really difficult to built as I have tried to add ccs transition on a image. 
The probblem was that the transition was not working as I expected to work. Therefore,
I have used W3SCHOOL website for image transition and it worked fine.

#In the contact.html page. I have decided to add google map and location for the resturant. 
The problem I have facing was that I couldn't add the location to the google map and did some research to make it work
I have over come the issue by adding API key from Google and also found the right coordinates for the location (52.639583, -1.128667);,

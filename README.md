# Page Layout:
The first start of the website was to set up responsive page layout 
for different web pages that I am going to use for displaying information.
I have used Youtube tutorial for building HTML website with responsive layout 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw&t=2677s) from this video 
I have managed to create a responsive web page layout and added all the pages that I needed.
